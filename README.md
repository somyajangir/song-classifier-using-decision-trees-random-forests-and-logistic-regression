Music Genre Classification with Logistic Regression

Overview:
This project aims to predict music genres based on audio features using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest algorithms. The dataset contains tracks labeled with genres like 'Hip-Hop' and 'Rock', described by acousticness, danceability, energy, and other features.

Approach:

Logistic Regression: Utilized as the primary model, logistic regression showed the best prediction performance among the three algorithms.
Decision Trees: Although effective, decision trees provided slightly lower accuracy compared to logistic regression.
Random Forest: While random forest enhanced prediction accuracy over decision trees, it still fell short of logistic regression.
Results:
Logistic regression outperformed decision trees and random forest in predicting music genres based on audio features. Its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification make it a suitable choice for this task.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, logistic regression emerged as the most efficient model for music genre classification in this project. Further optimization and feature engineering may enhance the performance of other algorithms.
